## **Types of Fractions**
 
3-types:

1. Proper Fractions
2. Improper Fractions
3. Mixed Fractions

### **1. Proper Fractions**
:   When numerator is smaller than denominator in a fraction, then it is called a Proper fraction.
    $$ Numerator < Denominator $$

    Examples are - 

    $\frac{2}{5}$, 
    $\frac{4}{15}$, 
    $\frac{7}{9}$ 

### **2. Improper Fractions**
:   When numerator is greater than denominator in a fraction, then it is called a Improper fraction.
    $$ Numerator > Denominator $$

    Examples are - 

    $\frac{5}{2}$, 
    $\frac{15}{4}$, 
    $\frac{9}{7}$ 

### **3. Mixed Fractions**
:   Mixed fractions have 2 components - a natural number and a Proper fraction. 
    
    Example - 
    $$ 2\frac{3}{5} $$ 

    Here, 2 is a natural number, 3 is numerator of fraction and 5 is denominator of fraction.

## **Convert Mixed Fractions to/from Improper Fractions**
Mixed fractions can be converted into Improper fractions and vice-versa.

### **Converting Mixed Fractions to Improper Fractions**

Steps -

1. Multiply denominator with natural number and add the product to the numerator to get a new numerator.
2. Use the same denominator as of original denominator of your mixed fraction.

Example -

$$ 2\frac{3}{5} $$

step 1. 5 x 2 = 10. 10 + 3 = 13. New numerator is 13.

step 2. use 5 as your denominator.

$$ \frac{13}{5} $$



### **Converting Improper Fractions to Mixed Fractions**

Steps - 

1. Divide numerator with denominator to find quotient (answer) and remainder. Quotient is your natural number and remainder is your new numerator.
2. Use the same denominator as of original denominator of your Improper fraction.

Example -

$$ \frac{13}{5} $$

step 1. Divide 13 by 5 to get quotient and remainder. you will get Quotient = 2 and Remainder = 3. 2 will be your natural number and 3 will be your numertor for the mixed fraction.

step 2. use 5 as your denominator.

$$ 2\frac{3}{5} $$
