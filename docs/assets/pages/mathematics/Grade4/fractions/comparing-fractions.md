## **Comparing Fractions**

3-cases:

1. When dominators are same.
2. When numerators are same.
3. When denominators and numerators are not same.

### **1. When denominators are same**
:   When denominatos are same, we simply compare the numerators. Fraction with greater numerator is greater than other fraction. 

### **2. When numerators are same**
:   When numerators are same, then fration with smaller denominators is greater than other fraction.

### **3. When denominators and numerators are not same**
:   When both numerators and denominators are not same, then first we have to make denominators same.

2-subcases:


 === "Subcase 1" 
 
 
    **Subcase - 1. when one (smaller) denominator is a factor of other (larger) denominator.**

    Steps:

    1.      Simply find the multiple of this smaller denominator to make it equal to other (larger) denominator. 
    2.      Then, multiply numerator and denominator of this fraction (fraction with smaller denominator) with the multiple.
    3.      The resultant fraction can now be compared with other fraction. 

    Example:

    $$ Compare \frac{3}{5} and \frac{4}{10} $$

    - step 1. 2 is a multiple of 5 that when multiplied with 5 equals to 10, the number same as the denominator of other (larger) denominator.
    - step 2. Multiply numerator 3 and denominator 5 of fraction $\frac{3}{5} by 2, to get a new fraction.$

    $$ \frac{3*2}{5*2} and \frac{4}{10} $$

    $$ \frac{6}{10} and \frac{4}{10} $$

    - step 3. Now we can compare $\frac{6}{10}$ and $\frac{4}{10}$. In this case $\frac{6}{10}$ (or $\frac{3}{5}$) is greater than $\frac{4}{10}$.



=== "Subcase 2"


    **Subcase - 2. when smaller fraction is not a factor of other (larger) fraction.**

    The best apporach is find the Least Common Multiples (L.C.M.) of the denominators and then use this L.C.M. to further compare fractions. 

    But we are introducing an different method here. 

    Steps:

    1.      Multiply the denominator of first fraction to the numerator and denominator of second fraction.
    2.      Multiply the denominator of second fraction to the numerator and denominator of first fraction.
    3.      Now, the denominators are same, we can simply compare the numerators. 


    Example:

    $$ Compare \frac{3}{5} and \frac{4}{7} $$

    - step 1. Multiply 5 the denominator of first fraction $\frac{3}{5}$ with the numerator and denominator of second fraction $\frac{4}{7}$.  
    - step 2. Multiply 7 the denominator of second fraction $\frac{4}{7}$ with the numerator and denominator of first fraction $\frac{3}{5}$.  

    $$ \frac{3*7}{5*7} and \frac{4*5}{7*5} $$

    $$ \frac{21}{35} and \frac{20}{35} $$

    - step 3. Now, the denominators are same (35), we can compare $\frac{21}{35}$ and $\frac{20}{35}$. In this case $\frac{21}{35}$ (or $\frac{3}{5}$) is greater than $\frac{20}{35}$ (or $\frac{4}{7}$).
