## **Adding and Subtracting Fractions**

2-cases:

1. When denominators are same.
2. When denominators are not same. 

### **1. When denominators are same**

-   when denominators are same, we can simply add or subtract numerators. 


=== "Adding Fraction"

    Example:

    $$ \frac{4}{5} + \frac{3}{5} $$

    $$ \frac{4+3}{5} $$
    
    $$ \frac{7}{5} $$

=== "Subtracting Fraction"

    Example:

    $$ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{3}{5} $$
    
    $$ \frac{4-3}{5} $$
    
    $$ \frac{1}{5} $$


### **2. When denominators are not same**

=== "Subcase 1" 
 
 
    **Subcase - 1. when one (smaller) denominator is a factor of other (larger) denominator.**

    Steps:

    1.      Simply find the multiple of this smaller denominator to make it equal to other (larger) denominator. 
    2.      Then, multiply numerator and denominator of this fraction (fraction with smaller denominator) with the multiple.
    3.      Now, we can simply add or subtract 2 fractions 

    Example:

    $$ \frac{3}{5} + \frac{4}{10} $$

    - step 1. 2 is a multiple of 5 that when multiplied with 5 equals to 10, the number same as the denominator of other (larger) denominator.
    - step 2. Multiply numerator 3 and denominator 5 of fraction $\frac{3}{5} by 2, to get a new fraction.$

    $$ \frac{3*2}{5*2} + \frac{4}{10} $$

    $$ \frac{6}{10} + \frac{4}{10} $$

    - step 3. Now we can add or subtract $\frac{6}{10}$ and $\frac{4}{10}$.

    $$ \frac{6+4}{10} $$
    
    $$ \frac{10}{10} = 1 $$


=== "Subcase 2"


    **Subcase - 2. when smaller fraction is not a factor of other (larger) fraction.**

    The best apporach is find the Least Common Multiples (L.C.M.) of the denominators and then use this L.C.M. to further solve fractions. 

    But we are introducing an different method here. 

    Steps:

    1.      Multiply the denominator of first fraction to the numerator and denominator of second fraction.
    2.      Multiply the denominator of second fraction to the numerator and denominator of first fraction.
    3.      Now, the denominators are same, we can simply add or subtract 2 fractions 


    Example:

    $$ \frac{3}{5} - \frac{4}{7} $$

    - step 1. Multiply 5 the denominator of first fraction $\frac{3}{5}$ with the numerator and denominator of second fraction $\frac{4}{7}$.  
    - step 2. Multiply 7 the denominator of second fraction $\frac{4}{7}$ with the numerator and denominator of first fraction $\frac{3}{5}$.  

    $$ \frac{3*7}{5*7} - \frac{4*5}{7*5} $$

    $$ \frac{21}{35} - \frac{20}{35} $$

    - step 3. Now, the denominators are same (35), we can simply solve $\frac{21}{35}$ - $\frac{20}{35}$.


    $$ \frac{21-20}{35} $$

    $$ \frac{1}{35} $$
