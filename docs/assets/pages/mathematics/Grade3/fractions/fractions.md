## **Important terms**

### **Fractions**
:   Fraction represents parts of a whole.

### **Whole**

### **Denominator**
:   It is the bottom number in a fraction and it represents how many parts the whole is divided into.

## **Writing Fractions**

$$ \frac{Numerator}{Denominator} $$



=== "Example 1"

    <div class="result" markdown>
    
    ![fractions](fraction1.png){width=300}
    
    1 slice is separated (highlighted in orange) from the whole pizza, so numerator will be 1.<br>
    Whole pizza is divided into 8 slices, so denominator will be 8.<br>
    We can write this fraction as $\frac{1}{8}$

    </div>


=== "Example 2"

    <div class="result" markdown>
    
    ![fractions](fraction2.png){width=300}
    
    2 slice is separated (highlighted in orange) from the whole pizza, so numerator will be 2.<br>
    Whole pizza is divided into 5 slices, so denominator will be 5.<br>
    We can write this fraction as $\frac{2}{5}$

    </div>


## **Reading Fractions**

- Fractions are read as:
    * numerator over denominator
    * numerator divided by denominator
    * numerator-denominatorths


=== "Example 1"
    $$ \frac{1}{2} $$

    Here, 1 is numerator and 2 is denominator.<br>
    We call this fraction as:

    - 1 over 2
    - 1 divided by 2
    - one-half

=== "Example 2"
    $$ \frac{3}{4} $$
    
    Here, 3 is numerator and 4 is denominator.<br>
    We call this fraction as:

    - 3 over 4
    - 3 divided by 4
    - three-forths
