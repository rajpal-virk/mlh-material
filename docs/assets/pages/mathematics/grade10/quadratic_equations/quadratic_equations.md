## **Algebric Expression**

- Expressions are made of variables and/or constants
- Examples
    - x
    - y
    - x + 5
    - y - 3
    - $5x^2 + 10$

## **Algebric Equations**

- Equations are made of expressions with an equal-to in it.
- Examples
    - x = 10
    - y = 25
    - x + 5 = 15
    - y -3 = 50
    - $5x^2 + 10 = x^2 - 5$

# **Term**

- Terms  are mathemtical objects separated by addition (+) or subtraction (-) signs in algebric expressions.
- Word "Term(s)" is commonly used in algebric equation topics. 
- 3-types of terms
    1.  Constants terms
        - commonly called "Constants".
        - inludes only numbers (no-variables). 
        - example - 3, 4, 5, -10, -6
    2. Variable terms
        - includes variables only. example - x, y, z, a, b, c, $x^2$, $x^3$
    3. Mixed terms 
        - when variables are either multiplied or divided by numbers or other variables
        - examples - 3x, 4y, 5z, 6a, $ab$, $cd$, $ax$, $by$, $5x^3$, $6y^4$


- Like Terms
    - Terms in which *same* variables are raised to *same* powers


- Examples
    - $x + 5$ 
        - in above expression, there are 2 terms - x and 5.
    - $y^2 - 3$
        - in above expression, there are 2 terms - $y^2$ and 3.
    - $3y^4 + 2x^2 - 3$
        - in above expression, there are 3 terms - $3y^4$, $2x^2$ and 3.

# **Expand and Simplify**

## Steps

- Multiply each term in first brackets() to each term in second brackets().
- Do not forget to include negative (-) sign if present.

## Examples

- $(x+5)(x+2)$

$=x*x + x*2 + 5*x + 5*2$

$=x^2 + 2x + 5x + 10$

$=x^2 + 7x + 10$
<br>
<br>

- $(a+2)(a-5)$

$=a*a + a*-5 + 2*a + 2*-5$

$=a^2 -5a + 2a  -10$

$=a^2 -3a -10$

# **GCF of terms**

- $5x + 25$

$=5*x + 5*5$

$=5(x + 5)$
<br>
<br>


- $5x^2 + 25x$

$=5*x*x + 5*5*x$

$=5*x(x + 5)$

$=5x(x + 5)$

# **Quadratic equation**

- $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
- here 
    - a, b, c are numbers.
    - a and b are called coefficients. 
    - c is constant.
    - $ax^2$ - quadratic term since variable is raised to the power of 2.
    - $bx$ - linear term because variable is raised to the power is 1.
    - $ax^2 + b^x + c$ - this is quadratic expression.

# **Factoring Quadratic expression**

## Steps

1. Find product of quadratic term and constant term. 
2. Find 2 factors of this product which adds to the linear term.
3. Expand the linear term using the 2 factors found in above step. Now you have 4-terms in the expression.
4. Make 2-pairs of terms - 1st pair using 1st term and 2nd term, and 2nd pair using 3rd term and 4th term.
5. Find GCF of 1st and 2nd pair.
6. Group common factors.

## Example

- $4x^2 + 12x + 5$
    
    - step 1 - Find product of quadratic term and constant term. 
    
        $4x^2 * 5$
    
        $20x^2$
    
    - step 2 -Find 2 factors of this product which adds to the linear term.

        2-factors of 20 that adds to 12  are 10 and 2.  
    
    - step 3 - Expand the linear term using the 2 factors found in above step. Now you have 4-terms in the expression.
    
        $4x^2 + 10x + 2x + 5$


    - step 4 - Make 2-pairs of terms - 1st pair using 1st term and 2nd term, and 2nd pair using 3rd term and 4th term.
        
        1st pair - $4x^2 + 10x$, 2nd pair - $+2x + 5$

    - step 5 - Find GCF of 1st and 2nd pair.
        
        $4x^2 + 10x + 2x + 5$

        $2*2*x*x + 2*5*x + 2*x + 5$

        $2*x(2*x + 5) +1 (2*x + 5)$

    - step 6 - Group common factors.

        $(2*x + 5)(2*x +1)$

        $(2x + 5)(2x +1)$

# **Finding Roots of Quadratic Equations**

## Steps

1. Find Factors of Quadratic expression
2. Put each factor equals-to 0, you will get a new linear equation.
3. Simply solve linear equation to find value of variable.

## Example

- $4x^2 + 12x + 5$

    - steps 1 - Find Factors of Quadratic expression
        
        $(2x + 5)(2x +1)$

    - step 2 - Put each factor equals-to 0, you will get a new linear equation.
       
       - solving first factor.

        $(2x + 5) = 0$
        
        $2x = 0 - 5$
        
        $2x = -5$
        
        $x  = \frac{-5}{2}$

        
       - solving second factor.

        $(2x +1) = 0$
            
        $2x = 0 - 1$
        
        $2x = -1$
        
        $x  = \frac{-1}{2}$
