### Folder and Filename structure

These steps will help maintaining a proper foldername and filename structure for your codes. 

1. Create a new folder (main working directory) on Desktop. You can choose any name for this folder or simply call it by <yourname-python>. This step should be done once only.
2. Inside this main working directory, create a folder everytime you work on new sets of codes/scripts. Foldername format for these folders date should be in "yyyy-mm-dd" format. For example - "2024.02.01" - This foldername indicates that folder is created on 1st Feb 2024.
